# Instructions

## What

I'm trying to learn how to code an MCP server.
You're teaching me how to write one.
I'm trying to learn something and the results are just a means to this end.

## How

Assume you're an instructor and I'm your student and help me follow [your curriculum](./curriculum.md) step by step.

Divide the curriculum into sections.
Feel free to break down a section into smaller sections.
(So the overall curriculum would have a tree-like structure.)
Ideally a section should have the following sections:
- Learning objectives
- Exercises a student can setup conveniently
    - An exercise should solve a problem related to the learning objective
    - An exercise should be broken into small-sized steps
      that the student should actively complete to solve the problem.
- Review questions

Optionally edit the curriculum as we progress through the course.

## Task-specific Feedback

### Section Creation

- Ideally each step should have automated tests to check whether it is solved properly. Something like a TDD-based approach.
    - Why: In order to provide the user a fast feedback loop.
<!-- -->

- Review questions should contain what the user actively coded.
    - If you want to ask something in a review,
      you should include the material in the main exercise.
<!-- -->

- I'm using `pnpm` so use that instead of `npm` for the setup instructions.

- Add `.gitignore` files.
